The modulation matrix is where the true power of Odin 2 lies. A large amount of parameters inside the synthesizer can be modulated by a large variety of modulators.

\section{Basic Operation}

It might look daunting at first with the amount of controls it has to offer, but in reality it is nine rows of the same controls:

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{graphics/modmatrix_row.png}
\end{center}

\audioparameter{Modulation Source}{0}{0}{
    Sets up a source for the modulation. The source chosen in this slot will be controlling the parameter set by "Destination 1" and "Destination 2" by the amounts set by "Destination 1 Amount" and "Destination 2 Amount".

    For a list of available modulation sources, see Section \ref{mod_sources}.
}

\audioparameter{Modulation Destination 1}{0}{0}{
    Sets up a destination for the modulation. The source chosen in this slot will be controlled the source set in "Modulation Source" by the amount set by "Destination 1 Amount".

    For a list of available modulation destinations, see Section \ref{mod_destinations}.
}

\audioparameter{Modulation Destination 2}{0}{0}{
    An independent second modulation destination with identical features to "Modulation Destination 1". Destinations 1 and 2 do not interfere with one another in any way.
}

\audioparameter{Destination 1 Amount}{0}{0}{
    Controls how much the Source modulates Destination 1. Can be positive or negative.
}

\audioparameter{Destination 2 Amount}{0}{0}{
    Controls how much the Source modulates Destination 2. Can be positive or negative.
}

You can use the X-Buttons to the right of each row to instantaneously clear the entire modulation row.

\section{Modulation Scaling}

An advanced feature of the modulation matrix in Odin 2 is the "Modulation Scale" option. You can scale the modulation that was set up with the parameters above by another modulation source. The value of the source chosen for scale now controls the modulation depth. This way you can essentially modulate the modulation itself. A common use case for this includes scaling with the Modwheel: The set up modulation now can be controlled by the keyboard player by moving the Modwheel up and down.

\vspace{10mm}
Consider the following graphic: On the left side, an LFO is set up to modulate a parameter. On the right side, the modulation is scaled by another, slower moving LFO:
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{graphics/modulation_scale.png}
\end{center}
We can see how the actual modulation curve gets more complex instantaneously.

\audioparameter{Modulation Scale}{0}{0}{
    Select which modulation source is used to scale the modulations. Note that the scaling applies to Destination 1 and Destination 2 in the same way.

    For a list of available modulation sources, see Section \ref{mod_sources}.
}

\audioparameter{Scale Amount}{0}{0}{
    Determines the amount of scaling applied to the modulation. Using a scale amount of 100 is equivalent of multiplying the "Source" and "Scale" values together. For values between 0 and 100, linear interpolation logic applies between the raw modulation and and the multiplied values. For values below zero, the scaling source is inverted.
}

\section{Mono \& Poly Modulation}

Some of the modulation sources and destinations inside Odin 2 are polyphonic (i.e. exist once per voice), while others are monophonic (exist once per plugin instance). The following table summarizes the behavior when setting up poly/mono source and destination combos:

{\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.6}
\begin{tabular}{| L{0.2\textwidth} | L{0.35\textwidth} | L{0.35\textwidth} |}
    \hline
                                                              &
    \fat{Mono Destination}                                    &
    \fat{Poly Destination}                                      \\
    \hline
    \fat{Mono Source}                                         &
    single modulation source and destination                  &
    a single source modulates all destinations                  \\
    \hline
    \fat{Poly Source}                                         &
    only the most most recent voice modulates the destination &
    each voice is modulated independently                       \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
}

\vspace{5mm}
A similar logic applies when dealing with poly/mono modulation scaling.

\section{Modulation Destinations}
\label{mod_destinations}

This is an overview of all available modulation destinations in Odin 2. The column "Range" describes the amount of modulation that is applied if you use a "Constant" source and modulate by an amount of +100 or -100. Note that most destinations have internal logical limits for their modulation ranges. For example, the "Amplifier Pan" can not get out of the range [-1, 1].
